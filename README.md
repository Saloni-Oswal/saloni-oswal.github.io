# Interests
Apart from being a web developer, I love travelling, painting and cooking. I enjoy travelling to different places and explore different cultures. I am a foodie, and love experimenting with different cuisines.
When I am indoors, I will be found painting, cooking or binging on a TV series in my free time.
