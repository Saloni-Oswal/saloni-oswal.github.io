  <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
      In 2016, fresh off completing my Master's in Computer Science, I embarked on a journey to explore web development by creating a custom static website. Little did I know, this venture would plunge me deep into the captivating world of coding and web development. Fast-forward to the present day, and I've had the honor of crafting software solutions for diverse clients, including an e-commerce giant, a prominent multinational banking corporation, and several other innovative MVPs. My true passion lies at the intersection of design and engineering, where I relish in crafting software that not only boasts aesthetic appeal but also operates flawlessly beneath the surface.

    <p>
    From November 2022 I intentionally took a hiatus from my professional career to navigate a significant life transition. This break allowed me the opportunity to focus on personal growth, family commitments, and other aspects of my life. Despite not being formally employed during this time, I remained proactive in honing my skills, particularly in React, by staying updated with the latest industry trends and developments. Now, as I prepare to re-enter the workforce, I am eager to bring forth my renewed dedication, enthusiasm, and a wealth of experiences that have shaped me both personally and professionally.

    <p>
      When I'm not immersed in code, you can often find me exploring the vibrant streets of NYC, camera in hand, capturing moments of life and architecture. I have a penchant for savoring a good cup of coffee while delving into the city's myriad cultural offerings. Additionally, I'm an avid enthusiast of outdoor activities, always eager to embrace new adventures and experiences in nature.
