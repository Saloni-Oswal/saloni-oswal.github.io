    In 2016, fresh off completing my Master's in Computer Science, I embarked on a journey to explore web development by creating a custom static website. Little did I know, this venture would plunge me deep into the captivating world of coding and web development. Fast-forward to the present day, and I've had the honor of crafting software solutions for diverse clients, including an e-commerce giant, a prominent multinational banking corporation, and several other innovative MVPs. My true passion lies at the intersection of design and engineering, where I relish in crafting software that not only boasts aesthetic appeal but also operates flawlessly beneath the surface.

  During the period from November 2022 to June 2024, I intentionally took a hiatus from my professional career to navigate a significant life transition. This break allowed me the opportunity to focus on personal growth, family commitments, and other aspects of my life. Despite not being formally employed during this time, I remained proactive in honing my skills, particularly in React, by staying updated with the latest industry trends and developments. Now, as I prepare to re-enter the workforce, I am eager to bring forth my renewed dedication, enthusiasm, and a wealth of experiences that have shaped me both personally and professionally.

    When I'm not immersed in code, you can often find me exploring the vibrant streets of NYC, camera in hand, capturing moments of life and architecture. I have a penchant for savoring a good cup of coffee while delving into the city's myriad cultural offerings. Additionally, I'm an avid enthusiast of outdoor activities, always eager to embrace new adventures and experiences in nature.
